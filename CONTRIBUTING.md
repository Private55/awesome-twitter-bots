Hi! Thank you for reading this! 🤗

## Adding a bot
Lazy way: just [send me PM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/zntfdr) (or to [@awesomeb0ts](https://twitter.com/awesomeb0ts)).

Github way: please keep reading 👇🏻.

The bot doesn't have to be yours, if you think one bot should be included, feel free to add it!

### Bot Eligibility 
Every bot should be:

* awesome 😎
* at least 3 months old
* have at least 100 followers
* understandable by English speakers
* active (at least one tweet in the last 6 months)

There are always exceptions: 
if you think one bot should be listed even if it doesn't meet the criteria above, please [hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/zntfdr).​​​

### Categories
​​Every bot is listed in one and only one category, if you believe more categories are needed, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/zntfdr).
​​
### Format
​​For each bot that you'd like to add, please follow this format:

``
@botHandle Short bot description
``

the ``@bot_handle`` is the usual Twitter handle (e.g. ``@zntfdr``), keep the description **below 200 chars** (no period ``.`` at the end, no links, no author etc).

### Where to Add a New Bot
In this project there's a [BOTLIST](assets/data/BOTLIST) text file, just [go there](assets/data/BOTLIST), and add one or more bots following the guidelines above:

please don't bother sorting the bots, another bot (😜) will scan the file and automatically add it to the main page at the right position.

## Removing a bot
There are a few reasons why a bot should/could be removed from the list:

* the bot is no longer active
* the owner of the bot would like it to be removed
* the bot is no longer awesome (it can happen!)

There are always exceptions: 
if you think one bot should be removed for other reasons, please [hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/zntfdr).

Thanks for being awesome! 😃
